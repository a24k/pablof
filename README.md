# Features - Milestone Issue

[Milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
is a better way to track progress on groups of issues.
It is very useful for managing projects with multiple issues,
but there is not a sufficient way to describe or discuss about Milestone itself in detail.

## Concept

Milestone Issue is a issue linked 1:1 to Milestone.

As shown in the figure below, each Milestone has a linked Milestone Issue.
Each Issues in the Milestone should be tracked from the Milestone Issue.
All Issues on the Milestone consists of a single tree with the Milestone Issue as its root.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ma[Milestone A]
  mia[Milestone Issue A]

  ma -- 1:1 --- mia

  mb[Milestone B]
  mib[Milestone Issue B]

  mb -- 1:1 --- mib

  ti1[Task Issue 1]
  sia[Sub Issue a]
  sib[Sub Issue b]

  ti2[Task Issue 2]
  sic[Sub Issue c]
  sid[Sub Issue d]

  ti3[Task Issue 3]

  ti4[Task Issue 4]

  mia -- track --> ti1
  ti1 -- track --> sia
  ti1 -- track --> sib

  mia -- track --> ti2
  ti2 -- track --> sic
  ti2 -- track --> sid

  mib -- track --> ti3
  mib -- track --> ti4
```

## How to identify the Milestone Issue

1. list issues linked with the Milestone
1. filter issues by `trackedInIssues.totalCount === 0`
1. the first issue, in order of `CREATED_AT ASC`, is the Milestone Issue

## Actions
